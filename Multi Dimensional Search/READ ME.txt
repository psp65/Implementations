 * Class to perform Multidimensional Search on given dataset with 3 attributes
 *
 * Multi-dimensional search: Consider the web site of a seller like Amazon. They
 * carry tens of thousands of products, and each product has many attributes
 * (Name, Size, Description, Keywords, Manufacturer, Price, etc.). The search
 * engine allows users to specify attributes of products that they are seeking,
 * and shows products that have most of those attributes. To make search
 * efficient, the data is organized using appropriate data structures, such as
 * balanced trees. But, if products are organized by Name, how can search by
 * price implemented efficiently? The solution, called indexing in databases, is
 * to create a new set of references to the objects for each search field, and
 * organize them to implement search operations on that field efficiently.
