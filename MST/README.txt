Comparison of Kruskal's algorithm against Prim's algorithm implmented in 3 ways.
 * Prim 1) Prim's algorithm which keeps track of edge weights 
 * Prim 2) Prim's algorithm which keeps track of distance to vertices using Priority Queue 
 * Prim 3) Prim's algorithm which keeps track of distance to vertices using Indexed Heaps
